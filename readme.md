Update(2024):  
Seems my script does not work with iopaint(new version of lama-cleaner),  
please install a forked old version of lama-cleaner. https://github.com/david419kr/lama-cleaner  
(fortunately, "pip install lama-cleaner" still just works nice)  
------

A simple script for removing video watermark, using Lama Cleaner.  
Made this to use myself, but as it seems to work okay, I upload this.  
Only tested at NVIDIA windows environment.

Instructions:

Download files, at release tab, or code ZIP, or git clone, whatever.  
Run Lama Cleaner.  
Place "video.mp4" and "mask.png" in this folder, then run "run.sh" on terminal.  
("mask.png" is an image which has black background and white masking)  

If not working, pls check requirements below.

-- Requirements --

> Lama Cleaner must be running at 8080 port.

> Python3 must be installed. (Maybe you will automatically satisfy this requirement if you're running Lama Cleaner)

> No matter what is the original extension of the video, video file name must be "video.mp4".

> "mask.png" must be the exact same resolution with video file.
